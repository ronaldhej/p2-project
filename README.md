## About
This is just a small experiment to get to know the arcade game engine better, at the moment there's just one "person" that follows the cursor.
You can now also draw rectangles, the current size of the rectangle is shown as an outline before completion.

## Getting started
### Linux / OSX
Before trying to start the program or add packages, generate a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv` in the root folder.

Enter the virtual environment with the following command: `source venv/bin/activate` from within the root folder.

After this, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to fetch the required packages.

To exit the virtual environment, type `deactivate`

### Windows
No idea, I recommend doing the above steps with WSL

## Running the Program
`python -R main.py`
