## About
This is just a small experiment to get to know the arcade game engine better, at the moment there's just one "person" that follows the cursor.

## Getting started
### Linux / OSX
Before trying to start the program or add packages, enter the virtual environment with the following command: `source venv/bin/activate` from within the root folder

### Windows
No idea, I recommend doing the above steps with WSL

## Running the Program
`python -R main.py`
